# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis

The purpose of this challange is to analyze PyBer's ride-sharing data and create a summary DataFrame. The data that was gathered included city names,the type of city, total number of drivers, total number of rides, and the cost of each ride. We will compare various data between three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. Ultimately, we will compare the total fares The tools we will be using consist of Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib. 

## Results

By looking at the multiple-line graph below, it can be infered that PyBer's ride-sharing service generates the most revenue in urban type cities. The total fare in Urban cities ranges between $1600 to $2500 while the total fare in suburban and rural cities ranges between $700 to $1400 and $300 to $500 respectively. This data displays total fares from January 2019 to April 2019.
